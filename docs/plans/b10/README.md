# Phase 10 — Concurrency Hardening: Reliable Notifications & Media Body Delivery (b10)

## Goal

Fix the two production issues identified through deep analysis and reference comparisons (Dovecot/cmrelay, original Go madmail, Stalwart):

1. **Message loss / never-delivered under concurrency** — EventBus drops, notification-before-durability races, partial fan-out in group delivery, subscription windows.
2. **Images and videos do not load correctly** — Inefficient `read_blob` (full readdir + full load on every FETCH), UTF-8 corruption on binary bodies, lack of body path caching and range support, no streaming for large literals.

These directly impact 60-person groups with media attachments (the exact workload exercised by `context/cmping -g 60`).

This phase builds on:
- b2 (storage / blobs)
- b4 (SMTP delivery & fan-out)
- b5 (IMAP FETCH / APPEND)
- b6 (EventBus + IDLE notifications)

## The Two Things (Core Problems)

**Thing 1: Reliable concurrent notification + durable delivery fan-out**
- Silent drops on broadcast full
- Notify before file is durable (no dir fsync)
- Partial success in `deliver_local_messages` + hardlinks
- Remaining IDLE subscription gaps

**Thing 2: Correct + efficient large binary body serving**
- `read_blob` always does full directory scan + full `fs::read`
- `str::from_utf8(...).unwrap_or("")` on PGP-encrypted / MIME binary bodies in FETCH
- No body path caching (only listing cache exists)
- No range/partial body support
- Everything fully materialized in RAM (no streaming)

## TDD index

- [docs/TDD/README.md](../../TDD/README.md)
- [03-imap-server.md](../../TDD/03-imap-server.md) (IDLE, FETCH)
- [04-storage-layer.md](../../TDD/04-storage-layer.md) (blobs)
- [02-smtp-server.md](../../TDD/02-smtp-server.md) (delivery + notify)

## Implementation status (code + unit tests)

Phase 0 + Phase 1 (correctness, durability, reliability, media efficiency foundations) are
implemented with unit tests. The mandatory live validation (`relay-ping` protocol matrix and
`cmping --reset -c 1 -g 60` against a test server) **must still be run by an operator** — it
cannot run in CI / offline and is the gate for marking each stage fully complete.

| Step | Status | Code + unit tests |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| P10-S05 (binary body FETCH) | ✅ code + `p10_ut05_fetch_binary_body_roundtrip` | FETCH builds a single `Vec<u8>`; body/header sections appended as raw bytes (no `str::from_utf8`); response written + flushed once. Fixes media corruption + literal desync. |
| P10-S02 (durability + post-commit notify) | ✅ code + storage suite | `fsync_dir` after every `rename`/`hard_link` in `write_blob_mailbox`, `link_into_inbox`, `write_message`, `move_message`. SMTP/IMAP/router notify only after the durable write. |
| P10-S03 (partial fan-out) | ✅ code + `p10_ut03_partial_fanout_reports_per_recipient`, `deliver_local_messages_all_failed_is_error` | `deliver_local_messages` returns `DeliveryOutcome { delivered, failed }`; callers notify only durably-delivered recipients and log failures. Hard error only when all recipients fail. |
| P10-S01 (EventBus backpressure) | ✅ code + `p10_ut01_notify_without_subscriber_is_tracked`, `p10_ut01_slow_receiver_lags_then_resyncs` | No-receiver drops counted (`no_receiver_drops()`), `subscriber_count()`, capacity 64→256, version bump before send so drops stay recoverable. |
| P10-S04 (body path cache) | ✅ code + `p10_ut04_read_blob_known_direct_and_fallback` | `MailMessage` carries the listing-discovered filename; `read_blob_known` opens the body directly (falls back to the scanning `read_blob`), removing the per-FETCH readdir thundering herd. |
| P10-S06 (external blob store) | ✅ code + `p10_ut06_fs_store_roundtrip_and_link`, `fs_store_is_object_safe` | `ExternalStore` trait (`put`/`get`/`get_range`/`link`/`delete`) + `FsStore` over maildir (Go madmail `ExternalStore`+`FSStore` parity). Object-safe (`Arc<dyn ExternalStore>`) for future config-selectable backends; maildir remains the default path. |
| P10-S07 (range body serving) | ✅ code + `p10_ut07_read_blob_range_known`, `p10_ut07_partial_body_fetch_returns_window` | `read_blob_range_known` seeks + reads only the requested window (no full materialization); IMAP `BODY[]<offset.count>` partial FETCH echoes the origin octet. Memory now proportional to chunk size, not body size. |
| P10-S08 (centralized push manager) | ✅ code + `p10_ut08_push_manager_gauges` | EventBus formalized as push manager: non-blocking per-user broadcast already isolates subscribers (`Lagged` resync); added lag/subscriber gauges (`lagged_events()`, `total_subscribers()`) + a 120s IDLE egress timeout so a wedged socket is dropped instead of pinning its task. |
| P10-S09 (durable modseq) | ✅ code + `p10_ut09_modseq_roundtrip`, `p10_ut09_modseq_flush_and_seed` | `mailbox_modseq` table (additive sqlite+postgres migration); EventBus `inbox_version` seeded from it at boot and flushed every 30s by the state flusher → change-ids monotonic across restarts. Internal foundation; not yet advertised as CONDSTORE on the wire. |
| P10-S10 (E2E) | ⏳ pending live validation | Run operator validation (`relay-ping` + `cmping -g 60`) against the deployed build. |

### Live validation still required (per stage, by operator)

```bash
# Protocol correctness
context/relay-ping/bin/relay-ping -test connectivity -domain https://<server>/ -log-file - -vv
context/relay-ping/bin/relay-ping -test dclogin   -domain https://<server>/
context/relay-ping/bin/relay-ping -test throughput -count 5

# 60-person group with media (the killer workload)
cd context/cmping && uv run cmping --reset -c 1 -g 60 -i 0 https://<server>/
# Record: 60/60 notification success, media byte integrity, p95 fetch-cycle time, any loss.
```

## Steps (Staged with Mandatory Validation at Each Stage)

Each stage **must** include:
- Unit tests (new or extended P*-UT* tests)
- Protocol correctness via `context/relay-ping` (connectivity, dclogin, throughput where relevant)
- Real-world 60-person group validation via `context/cmping --reset -c 1 -g 60 -i 0 <server>` (or equivalent) **before** marking the stage complete

## Testing Strategy (Enforced at Every Stage)

**Unit Tests (always first)**
- Every step file must specify new `cargo test` commands (P10-UTxx or extension of existing).
- Tests must cover happy path, error paths, concurrent access, and binary data.

**Protocol Correctness** (see `context/relay-ping/cmd/relay-ping/main.go` and `internal/check/`):
- `context/relay-ping -test connectivity` → uses `internal/check/smtpcheck` + `imapcheck`
- `context/relay-ping -test dclogin` → `internal/check/dclogincheck` + `securejoininit`
- `context/relay-ping -test throughput` → `internal/check/throughput/throughput.go` (good for media load)
- `context/relay-ping -test latency_matrix` → `internal/check/latencymatrix/latencymatrix.go`
- Look at `internal/check/imapcheck/idle.go` for existing IDLE/push verification patterns that should be extended for reliable 60-way notification testing under media load.

**Realistic 60-Person Group Load (the killer workload)**
- At the **end of every stage**, run (see `context/cmping/cmping.py`):
  - `GroupPing` class (lines ~634+), `receive()` method using one `receiver_thread` per account calling `wait_for_event()` (from `deltachat_rpc_client`)
  - `setup_accounts` + `AccountMaker.get_relay_account(..., defer_online=True)` + `start_pending_online()`
  ```bash
  cd context/cmping
  uv run cmping --reset -c 1 -g 60 -i 0 <target-server>
  ```
- Measure and record (current tool emits per-seq RTT + loss; future advancement needed in `cmping.py` for explicit media integrity hashes, notification success counters, and body corruption detection):
  - Notification delivery success rate (60/60)
  - Body integrity for text + at least one image/video attachment (currently relies on Delta Chat successful decrypt/display)
  - p95 time for the full client fetch cycle
  - Any "lost" messages or media failures

**Specific files to examine/extend later**:
- `context/cmping/cmping.py` (receive loop, GroupPing class, defer_online logic)
- `context/cmping/test_cmping_dclogin.py` (existing dclogin test pattern)

**Reference Baselines**
- Always compare against a known-good cmdeploy server (cmdeploy_example or equivalent) running the same cmping command.

## Verification Command Examples (per stage)

See individual step files. Typical pattern:

```bash
# Unit
cargo test p10_ut01

# Protocol
context/relay-ping/bin/relay-ping -test connectivity -domain https://<your-test-server>/ -log-file - -vv

# 60-person group (run after every stage)
cd context/cmping && uv run cmping --reset -c 1 -g 60 -i 0 https://<your-test-server>/
```

---

**This plan must be executed stage-by-stage. No stage is considered complete until the unit tests pass + relay-ping protocol checks pass + cmping -g 60 (with media) shows no regression in loss or media loading compared to the previous stage + a known-good reference server.**
