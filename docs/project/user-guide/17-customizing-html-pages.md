# Customizing the HTML Pages and Web Interface

Every chatmail server serves a public web interface. This includes the main page, registration (`/new`), contact sharing, invite pages, documentation at `/docs/`, and other assets.

By default it uses the built-in pages that ship with the server. You can customize these pages to match your own branding, language, or requirements.

## Why Customize the HTML?

Common reasons include:

- Adding your own logo, colors, or domain branding.
- Providing instructions in your local language.
- Adding specific rules, legal notices, or contact information.
- Creating a minimal or "stealth" public appearance.
- Hosting your own customized version of the documentation.

## How It Works

The server supports a setting called `www_dir`. When this is configured, the server will look for files in your custom directory first. If a requested file is not found there, it falls back to the built-in version.

This means you only need to provide the files you want to change — everything else continues to work normally.

### Setting a Custom WWW Directory

Add the following to your configuration file:

```toml
www_dir = "/var/lib/maddy/www"
```

Or use the CLI:

```bash
madmail html-serve /var/lib/maddy/www
```

To go back to the built-in (embedded) files:

```bash
madmail html-serve embedded
```

Then reload the server:

```bash
madmail reload
```

Make sure the directory is readable by the user the `madmail` service runs as (usually the `madmail` system user).

## Getting Started with Customization

A typical starting workflow is:

1. Create your `www_dir` (for example `/var/lib/maddy/www`).
2. Copy the default files you want to customize from the server's built-in assets.
3. Edit the copied files.
4. Reload the server and test.

Many operators start by copying the entire default web tree and then gradually replacing individual files as needed.

## What You Can Customize

You can override most public-facing pages and assets, including:

- The main landing page (`index.html`)
- Registration and invite pages
- Contact sharing pages (`/share`)
- Documentation pages under `/docs/`
- CSS, images, and JavaScript
- Error pages

This gives you a lot of flexibility without having to modify the server binary itself.

## The Server's Own Documentation

Every running chatmail server also serves a full set of documentation at:

```
https://your-server/docs/
```

This documentation is multi-language and includes a guide specifically about HTML customization (often reachable at a path like `/docs/custom-html`).

This built-in guide matches the running server version and lists which files you can override and any special features available.

## Security Considerations

- The server will serve any static file it finds in the `www_dir`. Do not place sensitive files (private keys, database files, logs, etc.) in this directory.
- If you are using TLS (strongly recommended), your customized pages will be served over HTTPS.
- Be careful with JavaScript and forms — any custom code runs in the user's browser with the same origin as your server.

## Updating After Changes

In most cases you only need to run:

```bash
madmail reload
```

after changing files in your `www_dir`. A full restart is rarely required for HTML changes.

Users may need to do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) in their browser to see updated static assets.

## Common Examples

- Community servers adding local rules and support contact information.
- Organizations applying their corporate branding.
- Operators in restricted regions creating a minimal public footprint while keeping full functionality.
- Providing translated documentation tailored to local users.

## Further Reading

The reference shipped with your running server is at `/docs/custom-html` (or the equivalent path). It matches the madmail version you have installed.

You can also explore the `www-src/` directory in the source code to see the default structure and templates.
